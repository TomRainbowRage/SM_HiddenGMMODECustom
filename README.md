# SM_Hidden Game Mode Custom
A Hidden plugin for sourcemod that i made for me and my freinds

## How the GameMode works
One (Or More) people are the hidden who are invisible and have a buffed movement speed and health, the hidden can ONLY use there knife and/or util + zeus.   
The people on the other team will be trying to fight this person with there guns and working together to kill the hidden

## Features
- Customisable config in start command [hidden team, hidden health, hidden movement speed, hidden alpha value]
- The Hidden will automatically drop the guns they pickup thats not there knife or util or zeus
- The Hidden can be completly invisible or be slightly visible with the alpha value.

## How to play (Commands)

To start the game you will want to use the `h_start` command
`h_start <Team:[t/ct/auto]> <Health:[200]> <MovementSpeed:[1.5]> <AlphaValue:[200]>`
Example : `h_start auto 200 1.5 50`
